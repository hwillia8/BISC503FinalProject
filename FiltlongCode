#examples of Filtlong code used to filter short and low-quality reads


  #Creates a directory for filtered reads. --min_length 1000 keeps reads ≥ 1000 bp, and --min_mean_q 10 keeps reads with mean quality ≥ 10
  #utput is redirected to b3_filtlong_filter
mkdir filtlong_b3


#Filters reads from b3_reads.fastq.gz
filtlong --min_length 1000 --min_mean_q 10 b3_reads.fastq.gz > ./filtlong_b3/b3_filtlong_filter

#Compresses the filtered file
gzip b3_filtlong_filter

  #Creates a results directory for all filtered outputs
mkdir ~/bisc503/FAB_classproject/FAB_results_filtlong_filtered


  #Used inside a loop, filters reads and sends output into pigz (parallel gzip) with 8 threads, writes compressed FASTQ to $out
filtlong --min_length 1000 --min_mean_q 10 {} | pigz -p 8 -c > "$out"
